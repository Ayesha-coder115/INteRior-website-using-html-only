        How to Decorate Your Home

        Moving into a new home can be one of lifes great joys, but it can also be a time of uncertainty, especially when it comes to decorating. How do you make your space look its best while reflecting your personal sense of style? Do it well and youll end up with a comfortable, happy home. Do it poorly and youll end up with a hodge-podge of furniture, fabrics and paint colors that never congeal into a pleasing whole. With a little planning, and by following the same steps used by professional interior designers, you will have a much greater chance of success.

To reach the finish line, you first have to know where you’re going.

        <h2> 1) Don't Start in the Furniture Store</h2>
Many have heard the advice to avoid grocery shopping when you are hungry, because it leads to poor choices. The same holds true for furniture stores  donot go shopping in a panic, just because you have an empty home. Yes, you need a sofa. But if you pick the pink-striped sectional just because you like it in the store, without taking measurements or thinking about the rest of the room, you are stuck with it. The rest of the room will have to be built around that sofa, and if it is too large for the space it will look forever awkward. 
<br>
Start in the room youre looking to furnish, armed with a measuring tape and a notepad.

    <h2> 2) Know Your Measurements</h2>
Matching the scale of furniture to the scale of a room is critical. A deep sectional sofa can easily overpower a small room and svelte chairs can get lost in a wide-open loft. Before you start designing, measure the length and width of each room you intend to decorate, along with the ceiling height and elements that could get in the way  stairs, columns, radiators and other obstructions. It is also a good idea to measure window openings, along with the wall space below, above and to the sides of each one, to get ready for window coverings.

“The first mistake most people make is that they buy things that are the wrong size  sofas that don't fit in the room, sofas that don't fit through doorways, tables that are too small, desks that are too big, nightstands that hang into the doorway,” said David Kleinberg, founder of the New York interior design firm David Kleinberg Design Associates. Carefully measuring your space can help avoid such problems.

        3) Decide How You Want to Live
    </h2>
This is the tricky part, and there are no right or wrong answers. Rooms can be traditional or modern, formal or relaxed, and visually warm or cool. “To the best of your ability, you have to try to discern how you would like to live in a given space,” said Ms. Hampton. “What will you be doing? How many people live there? Are there children? What are your ambitions for how you would like to live?” 
<br>
The decoration of a home for someone who regularly hosts large dinner parties, for instance, should be different from a home for someone who eats out at restaurants every night. The person who plans to host lavish fundraisers should have a different living room than the person who dreams only of crashing in front of the TV.
