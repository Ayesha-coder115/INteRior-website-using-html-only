    The main living areas, whether they are separate rooms or combined in an open-concept space, set the stage for life
    with family and friends.
    Create the Palette
    You can see colors, patterns and metal finishes online, but digital images are mere approximations of what the real
    things look like. Wherever possible, order color chips, fabric swatches and material samples to be sure finished
    products will meet your expectations. “You can order samples from most vendors, and it’s always best,” said Mr.
    Kleinberg. “Some colors blend together,” when viewed on a screen, he added, and it can be difficult to differentiate
    cool and warm tones.
    <br>
    <br>
    Don’t just look at the samples in isolation. Pin them to a board or put them in a tray to see how well they work
    together. “All greens play nicely together,” said Mr. Kleinberg. “All blues fight.” Putting samples side by side is
    the way to see if different colors and patterns will live in harmony or tension.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ms. Hampton sometimes goes one step farther. “When we’re working on a fabric scheme, we’ll put the fabric on the
    copier, reduce it, cut it into the right shape for the floor plan and paste it down,” she said, “so we can see how
    the various fabrics spread through the room.”
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Treat the Walls</h2>
    Paint colors are notorious for appearing different hues in different light conditions (and seeming to change between
    the paint store to home). This effect is only amplified once you slather it on four walls. For that reason, it’s
    never a good idea to commit to a paint color when you first see the chip in a store. Look at the largest chip you
    can get in the room you plan to paint, at a minimum. Better yet, paint large sample patches on walls or on boards
    that can be moved around and view them at different times of day.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Note:</b></u> As long as you test the color before painting the entire room, there’s no reason to be scared of
    bold, saturated colors.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once you have a color selected, choose the sheen. Matte or flat paints offer a pleasant gauzy appearance that also
    hides wall imperfections, but can be difficult to maintain, clean and touch up. “I tend not to do matte walls, in
    general,” said Ms. Hampton, who prefers paint with an eggshell or satin finish that is just slightly glossier and
    easier to scrub.
    <br>
    <br>
    Baseboards, moldings, doors and other trim can be painted the same color as the room to make them visually recede,
    or a contrasting color — usually an off-white in a room with colored walls — to make them more of a feature. Trim
    can also be painted with a different sheen than the walls. A semi-gloss sheen will bring more attention to moldings
    while adding durability.
    <br>
    <br>
    You should also decide how you want to treat the ceiling. You can paint it white for a crisp feel, or the same color
    as the walls for a cocooning feel. It’s safe to use a matte or flat sheen because the ceiling is rarely touched by
    dirty fingers or smudge-creating objects. If the surface is perfectly smooth, it can also be painted with a glossy
    finish as a design feature that reflects light down into the living space. (If your ceilings aren’t smooth, don’t do
    it — the glossy sheen will only highlight imperfections.)
    <br>
    <br>
    For something unexpected, consider looking beyond paint. Manufacturers offer a multitude of alternatives, including
    patterned wallpaper, grass cloth, upholstery fabrics, wood paneling and even stone and brick veneer.
    <br>
    <br>
    Choose the Furniture
    Working from your floor plan and inspiration images, choose the specific pieces of furniture — the sofas, chairs and
    tables — that will make the space livable. Depending on the desired vibe, you can go in wildly different directions.
    <br>
    <br>
    For a traditional room, focusing on a symmetrical layout often helps — for instance, installing a sofa and coffee
    table centered on a fireplace, with matching armchairs on either side. “A very symmetrical space can be beautiful
    and formal,” said Ms. Hampton. On the other hand, “if you choose a sectional sofa, it’s probably going to be a less
    formal space,” she said, with an asymmetrical layout.
    <br>
    <br>
    Seat height is also important. Sofas and lounge chairs in the same room should have seats that are at similar
    heights to avoid some people sitting much higher than others. In general, lower seats offer a casual, laidback feel,
    and higher seats come off as more formal.
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether the space is casual or formal, there is a rule of thumb to keep in mind: The number of dining chairs should
    roughly match the number of spaces for lounging. “That’s an old truth my father shared with me,” said Ms. Hampton.
    “If you’re planning to have 12 people at a dining room table, you should have 12 seats in the living room,” for
    entertaining before and after the meal.
